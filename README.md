### Installing

To install it in your realm / server , head to [Releases tab](https://github.com/QUATERS11/anticheat/releases/) and download the latest ``.mcpack``. 
Then import the pack to single player world and enable cheats.

After loading in , type

```
/function start
```
This would tag you as ``staff`` and you would be **immune** to the clearing system .
After running ``/function start`` you would see a structure loading above you and type

```
/function anticheat
```
in the repeating command block in the structure and enable it

**NOTE - All players with ``staff`` tag would be considered as the operators and would be immune to the Anticheat tests . To add more players as staff , do ``/tag <playername> add staff`` .**
